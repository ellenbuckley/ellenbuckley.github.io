Lab Expectations. In this group, I expect everyone to take ownership of their educational and research experiences, to think about their work in the context of long-term career goals, and to contribute to a supportive, collaborative environment where colleagues are not competitors. Respect, inclusivity, and a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination are central to our group and community. We will not tolerate any verbal or physical harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. A full list of Lab member expectations can be found [here](docs/BuckleyLabExpectations.pdf)..
