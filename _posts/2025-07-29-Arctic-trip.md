In April 2025, I traveled to UtqiaÄ¡vik, Alaska, to support a sea ice field trip for local middle school students. While I was there in an instructional role, I also had the opportunity to learn hands-on techniques for measuring sea ice properties alongside the students. A personal highlight was teaching a live class (via Zoom) of my Ice and the Climate System course while standing on the frozen Arctic Ocean.
