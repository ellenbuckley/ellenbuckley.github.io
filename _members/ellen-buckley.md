PI Ellen Buckley has nearly a decade of experience conducting research on sea ice using remote sensing platforms. As a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, she investigated the evolution of Arctic sea ice melt ponds using high-resolution imagery and satellite altimetry. During her postdoctoral work at Brown University, she developed an algorithm to identify individual sea ice floes and examined changes in the floe size distribution over time. Her research continues to focus on advancing our understanding of sea ice processes by integrating data from multiple satellite sensors to create a more comprehensive picture of the sea ice environment. Recently, she has expanded her work to include field-based observations and studies of Antarctic sea ice, and she is eager to continue growing her expertise in these areas.
