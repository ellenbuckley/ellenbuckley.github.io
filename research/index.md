Our research aims to understand the ongoing changes of the polar oceans by synthesizing information from remote sensing observations for a richer picture.  We utilize high-resolution remote sensing measurements to study ocean and sea ice properties and processes at both large and small scales. Bespoke algorithms are required for processing new observations and ingenuity is necessary for synthesizing datasets in an ever-changing landscape of remote sensing instruments. As the Arctic warms and the sea ice continues to disintegrate and become less reliable and stable for in situ measurements, remote sensing will become increasingly important for monitoring the polar regions, a vital sign of the planet.
